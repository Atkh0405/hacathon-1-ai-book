I am an AI assistant. I CANNOT:

YOU MUST DO THESE STEPS YOURSELF:

================================================================================
  YOUR LIVE URL
================================================================================

After deployment, Vercel will give you a URL like:
https://physical-ai-robotics-textbook.vercel.app

You can share this URL with anyone!

================================================================================
  WHY CAN'T I DO THIS FOR YOU?
================================================================================

- I don't have access to your computer's file system to upload files
- I don't have your GitHub password
- I don't have your Vercel account
- I cannot click buttons on websites
- I cannot log into accounts for you

These are security features to protect your accounts.
